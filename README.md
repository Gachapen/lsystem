# Distribution-based Grammatical Evolution of L-systems (DGEL)

This program is a command-line tool to generate and visualize L-systems.

## Requirements

It requires [Rust >= 1.22.1](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html) to build.
The [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) dynamic libraries may additionally be required.

## Run

Run `cargo run --release -- --help` to see available commands.
Note that the program has been designed for research purposes and does therefore not have a user-friendly and well-documented user interface.
